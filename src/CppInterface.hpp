// Wait! Don't these namespace override each other? Can you just keep-on adding stuff in namespace?

/**
 * @namespace DIAlign
 * @brief Generic namespace for all classes and functions of DIAlign
 *
 * This contains a brief description of the available functions in DIAlign. The
 * DIAlign algorithm can be called through the interface provided by
 * alignChromatogramsCpp(), which allows alignment of a set of chromatograms.
 *
 * @code
 *

  std::vector< std::vector<double > > data1, data2; // chrom coordinates
  std::vector<double > rt_data1, data2; // RT coordinates
  std::vector<double > rt_mapping; // global RT alignment

  int noBeef = 5; // nr of matrix cells w/o penalty

  AffineAlignObj alignment_obj(rt_data1.size(), rt_data1.size(), false); // Initialize AffineAlignObj

  alignChromatogramsCpp(alignment_obj,
    data1, data2,
    "hybrid",
    rt_data1, rt_data2,
    "mean", "dotProductMasked",
    rt_mapping.front(), rt_mapping.back(),
    noBeef);

 * @endcode
 *
 * The AffineAlignObj will have the fields indexA_aligned, indexB_aligned and
 * score populated, providing the aligned indices as output.
 *
 * Individual functions that perform the alignment can be called through
 * getSimilarityMatrix(), doAffineAlignment(), getAffineAlignedIndices().

  /**
   * Align two pairs of chromatograms derived from two LC-MS/MS experiments A and B.
   *
   * @param obj A object of type AffineAlignObj which needs to have at least capacity of the chromatogram length
   * @param r1 The first set of chromatograms, where each chromatogram is a vector of intensities. These chromatograms are XICs derived from a single analyte in run A
   * @param r2 The second set of chromatograms, where each chromatogram is a vector of intensities. These chromatograms are XICs derived from a single analyte in run B
   * @param alignType Available alignment methods, must be one of "global", "local" and "hybrid".
   * @param tA This vector has equally spaced timepoints of the XICs from run A.
   * @param tB This vector has equally spaced timepoints of the XICs from run B.
   * @param normalization Normalization method, must be one of "L2", "mean" or "none".
   * @param simType Similarity computation method, defines how similarity between two chromatographic points is computed. Must be one of (dotProductMasked, dotProduct, cosineAngle, cosine2Angle, euclideanDist, covariance, correlation).\cr
   * @param B1p Timepoint mapped by global fit for tA[0].
   * @param B2p Timepoint mapped by global fit for tA[tA.size()-1].
   * @param noBeef It defines the distance from the global fit, upto which no penalization is performed.
   * The window length will be chosen as = 2*noBeef.
   * @param goFactor Penalty for introducing first gap in alignment. This value is multiplied by base gap-penalty.
   * @param geFactor Penalty for introducing subsequent gaps in alignment. This value is multiplied by base gap-penalty.
   * @param cosAngleThresh In simType == dotProductMasked mode, angular similarity should be higher than cosAngleThresh otherwise similarity is forced to zero.
   * @param OverlapAlignment If alignment should be performed with free end-gaps. False: Global alignment, True: overlap alignment.
   * @param dotProdThresh In simType = dotProductMasked mode, values in similarity matrix higher than dotProdThresh quantile are checked for angular similarity.
   * @param gapQuantile Must be between 0 and 1. This is used to calculate base gap-penalty from similarity distribution.
   * @param hardConstrain Whether a hard constraint should be used for the similarity matrix. If false; indices farther from noBeef distance are filled with distance from linear fit line.
   * @param samples4gradient This parameter modulates penalization of masked indices.
   *
   * @note r1 and r2 need to have the same length and the chromatograms need to be in the same order (e.g. r1[0] needs to be the same XIC trace as r2[0])
   *
   * @note If no global fit is available, it is recommended to set B1p to tB.front() and B2p to tB.back()
