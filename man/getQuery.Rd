\arguments{
\item{maxFdrQuery}{(numeric) value between 0 and 1. It is used to filter features from osw file which have SCORE_MS2.QVALUE less than itself.}

\item{oswMerged}{(logical) TRUE for experiment-wide FDR and FALSE for run-specific FDR by pyprophet.}

\item{analytes}{(vector of strings) transition_group_ids for which features are to be extracted. analyteInGroupLabel must be set according the pattern used here.}

\item{filename}{(string) as mentioned in RUN table of osw files..}

\item{runType}{(char) This must be one of the strings "DIA_proteomics", "DIA_Metabolomics", "DIA_Proteomics_ipf".}

\item{analyteInGroupLabel}{(logical) TRUE for getting analytes as PRECURSOR.GROUP_LABEL from osw file.}

\item{identifying}{logical value indicating the extraction of identifying transtions. (Default: FALSE)}
}
\value{
SQL query to be searched.
